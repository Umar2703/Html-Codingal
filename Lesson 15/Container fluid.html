        <p>Coding, at its core, is the process of providing instructions to a computer in a language it understands,
            enabling it to
            perform specific tasks</p>
        <p>These instructions, known as code, are written using programming languages and guide the computer to execute
            actions,
            from simple calculations to complex operations.</p>
