        <p><mark>Space</mark> Space, in the simplest terms, is the vast, three-dimensional expanse that surrounds our planet and extends infinitely in
        all directions. It's the seemingly empty void between celestial bodies, but it's far from empty, containing dark matter,
        dark energy, and countless stars, planets, and other objects. Our understanding of space has evolved from ancient
        observations of the stars to modern scientific exploration, revealing a universe of unimaginable scale and complexity <code>dark energy</code></p>
