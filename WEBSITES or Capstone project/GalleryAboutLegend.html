    <h1>Pele The King of Football</h1>
</div>
</div>
 <div class="content-section">
    <h2>About His Career</h2>
    <p>Edson Arantes do Nascimento (23 October 1940 – 29 December 2022), famously known as Pelé, was a Brazilian professional
    footballer widely regarded as one of the greatest players of all time.
    Early life and career
    Born in Três Corações, Brazil, Pelé's passion for football developed from a young age.
    He joined the Santos Football Club at 15 and quickly became the league's top scorer at just 16 years old.
    Pelé's dazzling performances for Santos led the Brazilian government to declare him a "national treasure" in 1961,
    preventing him from transferring to European clubs.
    World Cup triumphs
    Pelé participated in four World Cups (1958, 1962, 1966, and 1970), leading Brazil to victory in three of them (1958,
    1962, and 1970).
    He remains the only player to have won three FIFA World Cup titles.
    His maiden World Cup victory came in 1958 at the age of 17, where he scored two goals in the final against hosts Sweden.
    During the 1970 World Cup, Pelé, at the peak of his career, delivered a goal-scoring masterclass (4 goals) and
    contributed significantly to Brazil's memorable triumph, which included a 4-1 win over Italy in the final where he
    scored the opener.
    Records and legacy
    Pelé's goal tally is a subject of debate due to inconsistent record-keeping during his era.
    According to the Guinness World Records, he scored 1,279 goals in 1,363 games (including friendlies) between 1956 and
    1977.
    He scored 643 official goals for Santos, a club record only recently surpassed by Lionel Messi.
    Pelé also holds the record for being the youngest player to score in a World Cup (17 years, 239 days), score a hat trick
    (17 years, 244 days), and score in a World Cup final (17 years, 249 days).
    His influence extends beyond the pitch, as he became a global icon and ambassador for the sport.
    Pelé is credited with coining the phrase "The Beautiful Game" to describe football.
    He also played a role in popularizing soccer in the United States during his stint with the New York Cosmos.
    Later life
    Pelé retired from football in 1977 after playing three seasons for the New York Cosmos.
    He was an outspoken political voice and served as a UNICEF Goodwill Ambassador, advocating for social and environmental
    causes.
    Pelé passed away on December 29, 2022, at the age of 82, due to multiple organ failure caused by colon cancer.
    Pelé's journey from humble beginnings to global stardom continues to inspire generations of footballers and fans
    worldwide.
