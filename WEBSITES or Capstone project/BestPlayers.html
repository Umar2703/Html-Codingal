        <p style="box-shadow: 2px 4px 10px rgba(18, 101, 255, 0.3); font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">
           
        Named after Ronald Reagan: Ronaldo's father named him after his favorite actor, former U.S. President Ronald Reagan.
        Expelled from school: He was expelled at age 14 for throwing a chair at a teacher, though this was a turning point in
        his commitment to football.
        Heart surgery: At the age of 15, he underwent heart surgery to correct a condition that could have ended his football
        career.
        Social media king: He is the most-followed person on Instagram globally, with over 500 million followers as of 2023.
        Philanthropic efforts: Ronaldo has a history of charitable giving, which includes donating the €1.5 million from his 2011 European Golden Shoe to fund schools in Gaza.

        <p style="box-shadow: 2px 4px 10px rgba(18, 101, 255, 0.3); font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">
            
            As a child, Messi was diagnosed with a growth hormone deficiency.
            FC Barcelona agreed to pay for his hormone treatments as part of his youth contract when he moved to Spain at age 13.
            His post celebrating the 2022 FIFA World Cup win became the most-liked photo in Instagram history, surpassing 75 million
            likes.
            Messi's senior debut for Argentina lasted just 47 seconds before he received a red card after coming on as a substitute.
            His first contract with FC Barcelona was famously signed on a paper napkin in 2000.
            He holds the record for scoring the most goals in a single calendar year, with 91 goals in 2012, surpassing the previous
            record held by Gerd Muller.
            He is also the all-time leading scorer for FC Barcelona, having scored 672 goals for the club.

            <h1 style="text-align: center; text-shadow: 2px 2px 10px rgba(0,0,0,1)">Mbappe</h1>
            <p style="box-shadow: 2px 4px 10px rgba(18, 101, 255, 0.3); font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">
            He donated his World Cup winnings to charity: Mbappé pledged all his earnings from World Cup tournaments to a charity
            that supports children's activities, particularly for sick and disabled children.
            He comes from a highly athletic family: Both of his parents were athletes; his father played football for AS Bondy, and
            his mother was a Division 1 handball player in the 1990s. His younger brother, Ethan, is also a professional footballer.
            He is the youngest player to score in a World Cup final: At 19 years old, Mbappé became the first teenager to score in a
            World Cup final in decades, and he later became the youngest player to score a hat-trick in a World Cup final during the
            2022 tournament.
            He is a huge fan of the FIFA video game: Mbappé has revealed that he spent hours playing the FIFA video game as a child.
            He has been the cover star for multiple versions of the game, including FIFA 21, FIFA 22, and FIFA 23.
            He could have played for other countries: As his mother is of Algerian descent and his father is from Cameroon, Mbappé
            could have represented either of those nations. However, he chose to represent France, winning the 2018 FIFA World Cup
            with them.

            Top goalscorer for Brazil: Neymar is the all-time leading goalscorer for the Brazilian national team, surpassing Pelé's
            record in 2023.
            Most expensive player: In 2017, he moved from Barcelona to Paris Saint-Germain for a world-record fee of €222 million,
            making him the most expensive player in history.
            Young father: He became a father at the young age of 19.
            Olympic gold medalist: He was a key player in Brazil's first-ever men's Olympic football gold medal victory at the 2016
            Rio Olympics.
            Known for his style: He is famous for his flair, speed, and dribbling skills, and is also known for his fashion sense
            and large social media presence.

            Ronaldinho was a key part of the Brazilian team that won the 2002 FIFA World Cup.
            He was part of an attacking trio alongside fellow stars Ronaldo and Rivaldo.
            His real name is Ronaldo de Assis Moreira.
            The nickname "Ronaldinho" was given to him as a child because he was often the youngest and smallest player on his youth
            club teams.
            In 2005, after scoring two solo goals in a match where Barcelona beat rival Real Madrid 3-0, he received a rare standing
            ovation from the Real Madrid fans at the Santiago Bernabéu.
            A 2005 Nike advertisement featuring Ronaldinho went viral and was the first video to ever reach one million views on
            YouTube.
