   <div style="background-color: #1a1a1a;"> <h1 class="main-header">About soccer: The world's most popular sport</h1>
   <p  class="nav-links">Soccer, or association football, is a team sport played by two teams of 11 players on a rectangular field called a
    pitch. The objective is to score more goals than the opposing team by moving the ball into their goal, primarily using
    feet, the head, or the torso. It is the most popular sport globally, with an estimated 250 million players in over 200
    countries.</p><br>
    <h1 class="main-header">History and governance
    </h1>
    <p  class="nav-links">Origin: The modern version of soccer originated in England in the 19th century. The Football Association was formed in
    1863 to standardize the rules of the game.
    International body: The sport is now governed globally by the Fédération Internationale de Football Association (FIFA).
    World Cup: FIFA oversees international competitions, most notably the men's World Cup, first held in 1930, and the
    women's World Cup, which began in 1991.</p><br>
        <h1 class="main-header">Basic rules and gameplay
    </h1>
    <p class="nav-links">Game time: A professional match consists of two 45-minute halves, with "stoppage time" added by the referee at the end
    of each half to account for delays. A 15-minute halftime break separates the two halves.
    Scoring: The team that scores the most goals wins. Depending on the competition, a tied score at the end of regulation
    can result in a draw, extra time, or a penalty shoot-out.
    No hands or arms: With the exception of the goalkeeper, players are not allowed to use their hands or arms to touch the
    ball.
    Fouls: Infractions result in free kicks, with more serious fouls within the penalty area resulting in a penalty kick for
    the attacking team.
    Cards: The referee uses yellow cards as a caution for misconduct and a red card for serious fouls, which results in
    ejection from the game.</p><br>
    <h1 class="main-header">Player positions
</h1>
<p class="nav-links">The 11 players on a team are typically organized into specific roles and formations:
Goalkeeper: Defends the goal and is the only player permitted to use their hands within the penalty area.
Defenders: Positioned in front of the goalkeeper to stop attacks from the opposing team.
Midfielders: Play a crucial role in both offense and defense, linking the defenders and forwards.
Forwards (Strikers): Primarily responsible for creating and finishing goal-scoring opportunities.
